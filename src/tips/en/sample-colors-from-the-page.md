Being able to sample colors from the page is super useful. Firefox, Edge and Chrome all allow you to do this in 2 different ways:

* In Firefox it's really simple and doesn't even require opening DevTools:
  * Go to the main Firefox menu
  * Go to the "More Tools" submenu
  * Click on the Eyedropper menu item

* There is a second way to do this in Firefox from DevTools:
  * Open the Inspector panel
  * Click on the eye dropper button in the typ-right corner of the panel

* In Chrome and Edge:
  * Open the Elements panel and select an element that has some CSS color set to it
  * Find the color in the Styles pane and click on the color swatch icon next to it
  * Just start moving the mouse over the page
