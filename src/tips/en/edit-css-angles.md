In CSS, several different properties use [angle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/angle) unit values, such as the `rotate()` function of a `transform` or the `linear-gradient` orientation of a `background-image`, and more.

In Chrome and Edge, wherever a value that uses an angle unit (e.g. `deg`, `rad`, `grad`, `turn`) is displayed in the Styles panel, you can edit it with a nice little visual editor instead of typing the number by hand.
