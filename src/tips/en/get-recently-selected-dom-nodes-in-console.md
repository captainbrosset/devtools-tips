If you type `$0` in the **Console** tool, in any browser, the currently selected DOM node is returned. This is very handy. To learn more, check [Get the selected element in the console](/tips/en/get-current-element-in-console).

On top of this, in Edge, Chrome and Safari, the `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, and `$4` shortcuts are also defined!

They can be used to access the recently selected DOM nodes:

* `$1` returns the DOM node you selected just before the currently selected one.
* `$2` returns the DOM node you selected before that.
* And so on!
