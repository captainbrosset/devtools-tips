Colors in CSS can be expressed in a number of different formats: keyword (e.g. `blue`), RGB, HSL, hexadecimal, and others.

In DevTools, you can easily convert from one format to the next.

* Find an element in the **Elements** panel (or **Inspector** panel in Firefox) that has some CSS color properties applied.
* In the **Styles** panel (or **Rules** in Firefox), hold **Shift** and click on the color swatch (the little colored circle next to the color value) to cycle through the different formats.
