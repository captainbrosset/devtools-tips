If you're feeling adventurous and want to write longer pieces of code in the **Console** to execute more complex things, it can quickly become difficult.

Thankfully, there are a few ways to make your life easier by writing on multiple lines, like you would in a code editor:

* Use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> to create a new line without executing the expression. This works in all browsers.
* Or ue Firefox's multiline editor. To do this, click on the **Switch to multi-line editor mode** button located in the top-right corner of the **Console** message area (or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>).

* Or you can create code snippets in Edge or Chrome's **Sources** panel. The added advantage of this technique is that code snippets are saved on your disk, and therefore can be used even after you've restarted the browser.
