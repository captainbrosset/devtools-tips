Sometimes, the JavaScript code that runs on a website is minified and really hard to read. This is common in production.

You can unminify code in DevTools to read it more easily, and also set breakpoints.

* Open a file in the Sources or Debugger panel
* Click on the `{}` icon at the bottom of the source code
