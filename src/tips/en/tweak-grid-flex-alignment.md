Chrome and Edge both have a visual editor useful for tweaking flexbox and grid alignment properties.

* Head over to the Elements panel
* Select an element that is either a grid or flexbox container
* In the Styles sidebar pane, find the `display: grid` or `display:flex` declaration
* Click the little icon next to this declaration
