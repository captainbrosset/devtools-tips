Do you use a CSS-in-JS framework? If so, you know how frustrating it can be to copy CSS from DevTools and paste it into your code.

Indeed if the CSS you worked on in the **Styles** panel looks like this:
test
```css
h1 {
  background: hotpink;
  letter-spacing: .5rem;
  margin: 2rem;
  font-size: 3rem;
}
```

your CSS-in-JS framework probably expect it this way instead:

```javascript
{
  background: 'hotpink',
  letterSpacing: '.5rem',
  margin: '2rem',
  fontSize: '3rem'
}
```

Although the 2 are relatively similar, it's frustrating having to change semi-columns to commas, adding quotes, and swapping hyphen-separated property names with their camelCase equivalents.

In Edge and Chrome, you don't have to. They both have an option that does the re-formatting for you:

* Right-click on any rule in the **Styles** pane.
* Select **Copy all declarations as JS**.

Note that you can also use **Copy declaration as JS** if you only want one. But this feature really shines when you copy all declarations at once.
