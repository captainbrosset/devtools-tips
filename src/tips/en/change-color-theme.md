title: Change the color theme of DevTools
tags: ["personalization", "browser:edge", "browser:chrome", "browser:firefox", "browser:safari"]

Chrome, Firefox and Safari all have a light and dark theme for their DevTools. Edge not only has those 2 themes, but also about 10 VS Code themes (like Monokai, Solarized Dark, etc.).

You can change the theme based on your preference.

* In Firefox
  * Go to the settings (press F1) and select "dark" or light"
* In Chrome or Edge
  * Also go to settings (press F1) and select "light" or "dark" in the Themes drop-down, or any of the VS Code themes in Edge
* In Safari
  * Go to the settings and select "Appearance" between "System", "Light" or "Dark"
