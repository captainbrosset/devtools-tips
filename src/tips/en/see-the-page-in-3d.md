See your page in 3 dimensions to quickly find out how deeply nested it is, fix z-index stacking issues, and performance issues.

* In Edge:
  * Open the command menu (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>).
  * Type `3D` and press Enter.
  * In the new panel that opens, switch between the 3 modes: z-index, DOM, and Composited Layers to visualize the page in 3D.
* Chrome and Safari also have a Layers panel that provides the same information as Edge's Composited Layers 3D mode.
