See your page in 3 dimensions to quickly find out how deeply nested it is, fix z-index stacking issues, and performance issues.

## In Edge

* Open the Command Menu by pressing <kbd>ctrl+shift+P</kbd> (or <kbd>cmd+shift+P</kbd> on macOS).
* Type "3D" and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The **3D View** tool opens up.
* In the tool, choose which 3D mode you want to use: **Z-index** (to visualize the stacking context tree), DOM (to visualize DOM nesting), and **Composited Layers** (to visualize the layers created by the browser engine to paint the page in separate chunks).

## In Chrome or Safari

Chrome and Safari also have a **Layers** tool that provides the same information as Edge's Composited Layers 3D mode.
